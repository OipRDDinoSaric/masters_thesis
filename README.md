# Master's thesis - Software and Hardware Architecture for Redundant Embedded Systems

Super project containing subprojects I worked on and pdf document that is my master's thesis.

## Summary of the thesis

Investigate the redundant architectures for embedded systems with respect to possibilities of redundancy implementation in hardware and software. Compare Cortex-R and Cortex-M microcontroller architectures with respect to redundancy in systems with functional safety requirements. Implement software for redundancy on the selected processor architecture. The software must include a bootloader and a modified FreeRTOS operating system. The bootloader must support the ability to load new applications and contain a command shell with accompanying functions. The modified FreeRTOS operating system must provide features of tracking the individual tasks execution time and task replication.
